# Baal & Spots

## Take Home Project Instructions

**Overview:**
The task is to build the Figma design provided in React. You'll want to make sure it's responsive (mobile design included in Figma file). This will give us an idea of how you structure your code and implement semantic HTML and CSS/SCSS.

### Instructions

1. `git clone https://github.com/baalspots/dev-applicants.git`
2. Open the project in VSCode (or other IDE)
3. In the VSCode terminal (you can also use the standard terminal instead of the one in VSCode), run:
   1. `cd project`
   2. `npm install`
4. Open Figma file [here](https://www.figma.com/file/gfE3cQUMM2XeZsRQwOFMIX/Landing-page?node-id=0%3A139).
5. There is a section at the bottom of the design with a row of cards. This is where you'll be implementing an API call to pull in some mock data for the cards.
6. The API url is `https://mocki.io/v1/b9c63035-97c5-40a0-b45c-2abdf5261bdf`.
7. The API will have more data than what is needed to be displayed, so make to to limit it to just show 6 cards.
8. In the `App.js` file, you'll see an import from `emotion-flex-grid`. Please use this when building the design. You can reference the documentation [here](https://github.com/rann91/emotion-flex-grid) or [here](https://rann91.github.io/emotion-flex-grid/).
9. The menu does not need to be functioning, it can just be the icon
10. Once you're finished with the design, publish the project to your Github account and send the link to [meaghan@baalspots.com](mailto:meaghan@baalspots.com) or in Indeed/LinkedIn/ZipRecruiter.

#### _Note_

If you have any issues with the repo, API, or Figma file, please reach out to me so we can get it resolved. If something isn't working as expected it could be a setting that needs to be updated on my end.
